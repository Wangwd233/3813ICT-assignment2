## Git
In this git repository the server side code saved in folder named server, and all angular components and service files are stored in folder src.

Every time I finish the development of a large part such as the set of server, after implement and check the login and logout function, I will save my work and push it to the github repository, so if I have some issue lose some of my code or I didn't satisfied with the change in later development, I can pull the branch from github to restore my latest version.
